Introduction 

This report provides some feedback about the ability tests which you recently completed. 

The tests that you completed provide a fair and objective assessment of your cognitive ability. Research has shown 
that these tests can provide reliable information concerning future performance in many different jobs. However, many 
other factors also play an important role in predicting job success. 

You may have already received personal feedback on these results, or had this offered to you. Whoever gave you 
feedback and/or this report should be qualified to answer your queries about any aspect of the report. 

This report is confidential and is intended for your personal use only. Please note that test results remain valid for 
about 12 to 18 months. 

The ability tests 

In order to gain a full understanding of the meaning of your scores on the ability tests, your performance has been 
compared to that of a large group of individuals who have taken these tests in the past. This is known as a 
comparison group. 

The tests that you completed include: 

The deductive reasoning test 

This test is designed to measure the ability to draw logical conclusions based on information provided, identify 
strengths and weaknesses of arguments, and complete scenarios using incomplete information. 

The inductive reasoning test 

This test measures the ability to work with incomplete information and create solutions to novel problems from first 
principles. People who perform well on this test will have a greater capacity to think conceptually as well as 
analytically.  

The numerical reasoning test 

This test measures the ability to make correct decisions or inferences from numerical data. The data presented and 
the tasks set are relevant to a business environment. The emphasis in these tasks is on understanding and evaluating 
data rather than on computation. People who perform well on this test tend to have the capacity to understand 
numerical data and interpret mathematical information correctly.

Your performance on this test indicates that your deductive reasoning ability is below average when compared to 
the comparison group. This suggests that using sound logic to solve problems, strengthening arguments, and 
identifying weaknesses in the propositions of others is unlikely to be a strength for you. 

Ideas to help improve your skills 

As this skill area is unlikely to be a strength for you, you may be interested in things you can do to help improve 
these skills. 

Developing your skills is something that requires considerable time and effort. As well as reviewing the practical tips 
below, think about the opportunities you have in your everyday life to challenge yourself in this skill area. How can 
you gain more exposure to this type of information? 

●  When you are debating with a friend or colleague, discuss why and how he/she came to his/her conclusions. 
The strength of an argument hinges upon whether a conclusion necessarily follows from the evidence. 
●  Many arguments leave steps out and assume that the reader or listener will fill in the blanks. Identifying and 

challenging these assumptions is one of the best ways to defeat an argument. 

●  When making arguments and drawing conclusions, always ask yourself if your conclusion MUST follow 
based on the evidence you have available. If not, determine what additional evidence is required or how 
your conclusion needs to be adjusted. 
If you implement a solution to a problem and it fails, reflect on your problem solving process to see if steps 
were left out, information was missing, or your logic was flawed. 

● 

●  Read editorials in respected newspapers and identify the evidence, assumptions, and conclusions in the 

arguments. Think of ways that you could challenge the conclusions made by the writer.

Your performance on this test indicates that your inductive reasoning ability is above average when compared to 
the comparison group. This suggests that understanding incomplete information and solving novel problems by 
creating solutions from first principles is likely to be a strength for you. 

Ideas to help improve your skills 

Although this skill area is likely to be a strength for you, you may be interested in things you can do to continue to 
improve these skills. 

Developing your skills is something that requires considerable time and effort. As well as reviewing the practical tips 
below, think about the opportunities you have in your everyday life to challenge yourself in this skill area – How often 
do you have to create solutions from first principles? To what extent are you commonly faced with new and 
incomplete information? How can you gain more exposure to this type of information? 

●  Complete timed problem solving exercises and puzzles in newspapers and puzzle books. 
●  Practise developing a few well-thought out solutions to issues at home and at work, even if a solution 

already exists. 

●  Before you make a decision, stop and think about whether you have sufficient information to make a logical 

rather than intuitive decision. 

●  Don’t always go with your first decision - force yourself to think of other alternatives before proceeding. 
● 

Learn how to skim documents quickly to extract the key information.

B 

A 

Your performance on this test indicates that your numerical reasoning ability is well above average when compared 
to the comparison group. This suggests that understanding or interpreting numerical data and mathematical 
calculations is highly likely to be a strength for you. 

Ideas to help improve your skills 

Although this skill area is very likely to be a strength for you, you may be interested in things you can do maintain or 
enhance these skills. 

Developing your skills is something that requires considerable time and effort. As well as reviewing the practical tips 
below, think about the opportunities you have in your everyday life to challenge yourself in this skill area – How often 
do you deal with numerical data and mathematical calculations? How can you gain more exposure to this type of 
information? 

●  When you encounter situations at work or at home that require maths, use a paper and pencil to solve the 

problem. Do all calculations by hand when possible and check your answers using a calculator. 

●  Practise converting real-life situations that require maths into equations on paper. This will help you identify 
all the variables in a problem, solve the problems by hand, and learn how to apply your knowledge to similar 
problems you encounter in the future. 

●  Understand the relationship among decimals, fractions, and percentages and how to convert from one to the 

● 

other. 
Learn how to evaluate and interpret charts and graphs and consider alternative ways that the data could be 
presented. 

●  Determine how to use all the basic, intermediate, and advanced functions on your calculator and any 

mathematical functions of spreadsheet software that you use.
