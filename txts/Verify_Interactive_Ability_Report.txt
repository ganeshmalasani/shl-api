SHL Verify Interactive Report

This SHL Verify Interactive Report provides the scores from Ms Sample Candidate’s SHL Verify Interactive Tests. If 

these tests were unsupervised, there is a small possibility that these scores do not represent her actual level of 

ability. Overview

This test measures the ability to work with incomplete information and create solutions to novel problems from first 
principles. People who perform well on this test will have a greater capacity to think conceptually as well as analytically.

Percentile compared to the Interactive Inductive Reasoning General Composite (INT) v1 comparison group

Ms Sample Candidate’s estimated inductive critical reasoning ability is below average when compared to the 
comparison group. Her result is better than 28% of the people in this group. This suggests that she will have 
difficulty in understanding incomplete information and solving novel problems by creating solutions from first 
principles.

Numerical Reasoning

This test measures the ability to make correct decisions or inferences from numerical data. The data presented and the 
tasks set are relevant to a business environment. The emphasis in these tasks is on understanding and evaluating data 
rather than on computation. People who perform well on this test tend to have the capacity to understand numerical 
data and interpret mathematical information correctly.

Ms Sample Candidate’s estimated numerical ability is average when compared to the comparison group. Her result is 
better than 57% of the people in this group. This suggests that she will be as able as most in understanding or 
interpreting numerical data and mathematical calculations as compared to the group.

Deductive Reasoning

This test is designed to measure the ability to draw logical conclusions based on information provided, identify strengths 
and weaknesses of arguments, and complete scenarios using incomplete information.

Deductive Reasoning

Language:

English - US

67

Percentile compared to the Interactive Deductive Reasoning General Composite (INT) v1 comparison group

Ms Sample Candidate demonstrates average deductive reasoning ability compared to the comparison group. Her result 
is better than 67% of the people in this group. She can draw logical conclusions from available data and make sound 
arguments as well as most people who score in this zone. She has an average ability to solve problems effectively and 
identify underlying assumptions in arguments. At work, she should be able to use data and information as effectively as 
most others in developing solutions to problems. Like most other people in the comparison group, however, this person 
may require additional time or assistance to put together solutions for particularly complex problems.

Guidelines for using these results

How to verify a result

There are many ways to confirm an individual’s ability level. Some techniques are listed below:

Consider information from other 
competency assessments

Use information from other sources

Use results from other assessments that relate to the competencies 
and/or skills important for performance in the job to evaluate the 
person’s actual ability level. For example work simulations, or 
assessment centres.

Results from examinations, qualifications, grades and other attainment 
tests that are appropriate measures of a person’s cognitive ability may 
help to evaluate the person’s actual ability level.

Use structured interviewing 
techniques to probe related 
competencies

Competencies related to cognitive ability include:
Presenting & Communicating Information

●
● Writing & Reporting
●

Applying Expertise & Technology
Analysing
Learning & Researching
Creating & Innovating
Formulating Strategies & Concepts

●

●

●

●

The final decision on how to confirm and use the person’s test results should follow internal policies and guidelines. 
Companies should evaluate the risks involved, corporate policy/governance, the use of other screening and selection 
tools, time, cost and other factors. All of these may be important when deciding the most appropriate method to verify 
an individual’s Ability Test results.

 The bar chart displays the individual’s percentile score from the Ability Test.
 The comparison group identifies the specific group of people this person’s score is compared against.
 The percentile score indicates how well this person scored against the people in the comparison group.
 For example, a percentile score of 50 means that the individual performed better than 50% of the people in

the comparison group.

About cognitive ability tests
Cognitive ability is the most effective, single predictor of future performance in many different jobs. However, many 
other factors also play an important role in predicting job performance. The information in this document should be 
used as part of a broader evaluation of this person’s suitability and potential for the job.
