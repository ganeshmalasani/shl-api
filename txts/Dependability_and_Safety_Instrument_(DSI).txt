The DSI is a short pre-screening tool for many key entry-level roles. It is designed to

Knowledge, Skills, Abilities and Competencies Measured
The DSI identifies people who are more likely to have good attendance records, be effective 
and positive team members, and have fewer accidents. Each candidate is given a score that 
indicates whether he or she is likely to be a safe, reliable and productive employee.

The DSI helps you:

•  Reduce accidents at work

•  Boost productivity and customer satisfaction through more dependable staff

•  Reduce days lost due to absenteeism

Unwarranted absenteeism is not only costly in terms of lost productivity, it also impacts 
customer satisfaction. Work-related accidents can also lead to prolonged absence, and 
the costs of litigation. We have worked with clients across a wide range of industries to 
identify low-risk, highly dependable employees for a wide range of positions, from front-
line customer service to operational roles.
