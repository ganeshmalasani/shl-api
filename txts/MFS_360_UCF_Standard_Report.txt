Description:
This is the default MFS report. It is based on the UCF20 competency model. The report will only show those scales that were selected as part of the questionnaire setup. The importance rating, open questions and multiple choice questions are optional parts of the questionnaire. Only if those parts were added to the questionnaire will they show in the report. Open and multiple Choice questions are of the clients’ own design. The example report here does not include developments tips, but those can be added if requested (see performance and potential report for examples of that).

UCF Feedback Report

Introduction

Constructive feedback is increasingly recognised as a key to enhancing managerial effectiveness .

This report provides you with detailed feedback on your skills, abilities, personal attributes and other job relevant 
characteristics, as seen from a number of different perspectives: specifically your own, your manager’s, and, if 
participating, your direct reports’, colleagues’ and ‘others’ (e.g. internal clients - as selected by you). It is based on the 
analysis of responses to the Universal Competency Framework questionnaire which you and these other people 
completed recently.

In using this report it is important to remember that the information it contains is a reflection of different peoples’ 
perceptions of you at a particular point in time. It does not represent some absolute, unchanging, all consuming truth. 
Nevertheless, the detailed analysis it permits can enable you to achieve new insights into your own strengths, and also 
alert you to aspects of your behaviour which could be proving a hindrance to your success in both the short and longer 
term. Such increased self awareness can, in turn, help you to maximise your effectiveness and develop your full potential .

It is recommended that you read through your report with a trained facilitator.

Competency Summary

This section summarizes how you have been rated by your various (groups of) raters on each of the  competencies. These 
are the average of the ratings on the individual questions which make up a given competency.  This section will enable you 
to see at a glance how your self perception compares with how others see you. It can be used as a basis for identifying the 
competencies in need for further exploration.

Your own ratings are represented by the first bar from the top , followed by your manager’s ratings in the second bar . If 
other groups of raters have participated, the next bars indicate the ratings of your colleagues, your direct reports and 
others respectively. The values summarize the average of the ratings on the four questions forming a competency. The 
ratings of a group of raters have been averaged across the group.

Please note: Where ‘No Evidence’ has been indicated by a rater, the average rating for any question is based on the 
ratings given by the remaining assessors in that group. N/ E indicates that all raters in that group rated ‘No Evidence’ for 
that item.
