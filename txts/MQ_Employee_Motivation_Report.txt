Introduction 

This report describes the factors that are likely to have an impact on Sample’s motivation at work. 

It provides a high level summary of Sample's motivators and demotivators followed by more detailed information 
on what is likely to motivate and demotivate Sample at work including tips and suggestions on how to keep him 
motivated. 

This report is based on Sample's responses to the Motivation Questionnaire (MQ). The accuracy of this report 
depends on the frankness with which he answered the questions as well as his self-awareness. 

This report has a shelf-life of 18-24 months and should be treated confidentially. If there are major changes in 
Sample's life or work he should complete the MQ again. 

Summary 

Sample’s key motivators and demotivators are summarised below. Typically, focusing on areas that are 
highly motivating or demotivating is most effective. 

To maximise the value of this information it is important to confirm with Sample what motivates him, and to 
discuss with him the impact of this in his current or future role.
