Description:
This participant-oriented report is aimed at individual contributors (non-managerial) and summarizes the way that they have described their typical style at work and is interpreted against SHL's Digital Readiness Framework. The report describes the way the person typically behaves, rather than their actual skill levels. It gives an indication of the individual's likely strengths in each area and makes suggestions for development activities, based upon the information gained from the
questionnaire.

Note: this report is specifically aimed at Individual Contributors. A version designed for Managers is also available (see Digital Readiness Report - Managers).
