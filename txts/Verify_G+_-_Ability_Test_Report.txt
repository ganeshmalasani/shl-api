G+ Report

This G+ Report provides the scores from Mr Sample Candidate’s G+ Ability Tests. If these tests were unsupervised, 
there is a small possibility that these scores do not represent his actual level of ability.

General Ability Description
The General Ability score is based on performance on all of the questions on this test across all cognitive abilities. 
Every candidate has strengths and weaknesses, but this score gives an indication of how the candidate is likely to 
perform on cognitively loaded tasks generally. For more specific information about the candidate’s strengths and 
weaknesses, please refer to the feedback for each of the cognitive abilities included in the test.

Percentile compared to the G+ General Composite (INT) v1 comparison group

Mr Sample Candidate’s estimated general ability is above average when compared to the comparison group. His result 
is better than71% of the people in this group. This suggests that he will display a high level of ability in cognitively 
loaded tasks generally as compared to the group.

Inductive Reasoning Description
This test measures the ability to work with incomplete information and create solutions to novel problems from first 
principles. People who perform well on this test will have a greater capacity to think conceptually as well as analytically.

Numerical Ability Description
This test measures the ability to make correct decisions or inferences from numerical data. The data presented and the 
tasks set are relevant to a business environment. The emphasis in these tasks is on understanding and evaluating data 
rather than on computation. People who perform well on this test tend to have the capacity to understand numerical 
data and interpret mathematical information correctly.

Percentile compared to the G+ General Composite (INT) v1 comparison group

Mr Sample Candidate’s estimated numerical ability is above average when compared to the comparison group. His 
result is better than 72% of the people in this group. This suggests that he will display a high level of ability in 
understanding or interpreting numerical data and mathematical calculations as compared to the group.

Deductive Reasoning Description
This test is designed to measure the ability to draw logical conclusions based on information provided, identify 
strengths and weaknesses of arguments, and complete scenarios using incomplete information.

Percentile compared to the G+ General Composite (INT) v1 comparison group

Mr Sample Candidate demonstrates average deductive reasoning ability compared to the comparison group. His result 
is better than 59% of the people in this group. He can draw logical conclusions from available data and make sound 
arguments as well as most people who score in this zone. He has an average ability to solve problems effectively and 
identify underlying assumptions in arguments. At work, he should be able to use data and information as effectively as 
most others in developing solutions to problems. Like most other people in the comparison group, however, he may 
require additional time or assistance to put together solutions for particularly complex problems.

Guidelines for using these results

How to verify a result

There are many ways to confirm an individual’s ability level. Some techniques are listed below:

Consider information from other 
competency assessments

Use information from other sources

Use results from other assessments that relate to the competencies 
and/or skills important for performance in the job to evaluate the 
person’s actual ability level. For example work simulations, or 
assessment centres.

Results from examinations, qualifications, grades and other attainment 
tests that are appropriate measures of a person’s cognitive ability may 
help to evaluate the person’s actual ability level.

Use structured interviewing 
techniques to probe related 
competencies

Competencies related to cognitive ability include:
●   Presenting & Communicating Information
●   Writing & Reporting
●   Applying Expertise & Technology
●   Analysing
●   Learning & Researching
●   Creating & Innovating
●   Formulating Strategies & Concepts

The final decision on how to confirm and use the person’s test results should follow internal policies and guidelines. 
Companies should evaluate the risks involved, corporate policy/governance, the use of other screening and selection 
tools, time, cost and other factors. All of these may be important when deciding the most appropriate method to verify 
an individual’s Ability Test results.

Comparison group used

 The bar chart displays the individual’s percentile score from the Ability Test.
 The comparison group identifies the specific group of people this person’s score is compared against.
 The percentile score indicates how well this person scored against the people in the comparison group.
 For example, a percentile score of 50 means that the individual performed better than 50% of the people in 

the comparison group.

About cognitive ability tests
Cognitive ability is the most effective, single predictor of future performance in many different jobs. However, many 
other factors also play an important role in predicting job performance. The information in this document should be 
used as part of a broader evaluation of this person’s suitability and potential for the job.

Technical information

Scores for each of the Verify - G+ components are based on the full set of questions on the test. Therefore, Number 
Attempted, Work Rate, and Hit Rate are only reported for the General Ability score. For more information about how 
Verify - G+ is scored, please refer to the Technical Manual.

T-scores and Sten scores are provided for users who are trained in their appropriate use and interpretation.

A T-score is a standardised test score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. The Sten score is a 
standardised score on a 10-point scale. It has a mean of 5.5 and a standard deviation of 2.

The Report also includes information to give you an indication of the candidate's accuracy while completing the 
test. 'Number Attempted' refers to the number of questions the candidate has seen during the test. The total may 
include questions that the candidate has not provided a response to. 

Work rate provides a measure of how far the candidate has got through the test, and is the number attempted 
divided by the total number of questions in the test. This is expressed both as a percentage and as raw data.

Hit rate provides a measure of accuracy, and is the number of questions the candidate has answered correctly 
divided by the total number of questions attempted. This is expressed both as a percentage and as raw data.

Work rate and Hit rate provide measures of the number attempted and number answered correctly. More 
information on these measures is provided in the Verify User Guide. It is important to understand that because 
each candidate receives a different set of items, there is not a direct correlation between Hit rate/Accuracy and 
the Percentile, T or Sten score achieved; and individual with a lower hit rate may achieve a higher percentile 
score and vice-versa.
