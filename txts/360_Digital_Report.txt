Report introduction

Your 360 report

This report is the result of your recently completed 360 review, including a self-reflection and feedback 
provided by some of the people you work with. Because it draws upon multiple perspectives a 360 can be a 
powerful tool in helping you identify your strengths and areas of developmental opportunity at work.

You won’t always see your behavior in the same way others do. For instance, if you have direct reports, you may 
perceive that you’re giving them appropriate autonomy in prioritizing tasks, but they may perceive the same 
behavior as a lack of direction. Understanding where perceptions differ can offer insight into where you might 
be able to focus your development effort.

In the report you’ll see feedback from different groups combined under “All raters”. This always excludes your 
self-reflection and allows you to easily compare your ratings with those of others.

Competencies and behaviors

In the context of this report a “competency” describes a set of related behaviors that are important for the 
delivery of the desired results in an area of work.

For example, Decision Making is a competency and is associated with the following behaviors:

Making timely decisions

Making difficult decisions

Making considered decisions

Taking accountability for decisions made

Deciding and Initiating

How well raters believed each behavior describes you is reported on a 5-point scale where 1 = “Not well at all” 
and 5 = “Extremely well"   

The importance of competencies for your role

During your 360 review your manager and you were also asked to rate how important you think each 
competency is to your role. The degree of alignment between your and your manager’s perception of the 
importance is highlighted in the report.

Importance is reported on a 5-point scale where 1 = “Not important at all” and 5 = “Extremely important”

Overview

Alignment

Competency alignment

You may not evaluate your behavior in the same way others evaluate it. You might think you aren’t doing well in 
an area, while others may judge your performance as adequate or even superior. Likewise, there may be areas 
where you’re not working as effectively as you think.

The chart shows the alignment between different rater groups for up to 12 competencies. If more are included 
these can be found in the companion table.

Importance alignment

Different roles require different competencies and you and your manager may not always align on which are 
most important. This can result in one or both of you focusing on the wrong behaviors. This report allows you 
to compare perspectives. Alignment is highlighted in the pop up for each competency, as well as in the table. 
Once you have clarity on any areas where there is misalignment you can discuss these with your manager.

Detailed results

Competency ratings

Your behavior may vary depending on who you’re interacting with. This can impact how people from different 
groups perceive how effectively you apply behaviors associated with competencies. This section helps you 
understand how different groups perceive your behavior by providing the overall average rating for each 
competency and the average rating from each group (you, your manager, your direct reports, colleagues, and 
others).

Your manager’s importance ratings of the competencies are also included.

Hidden strengths and blind spots

You may not see your behavior in the same way others do. This is where you may find hidden strengths and 
blind spots.

Hidden strength

Hidden Strengths represent competencies where you gave yourself a relatively low rating, but that others saw 
as a strength. These could be areas you can capitalize on.

Blind Spot

Blind spots are areas where you rated yourself highly compared to others who gave you lower ratings. This 
could mean you are not applying yourself as well as you think in relation to these competencies.

Other things to look for

High and low competency ratings: Competencies rated high reveal behaviors that you could 
immediately leverage in your role. Competencies rated low reveal behaviors where you might want 
to take steps to enhance your skills.

Differences between rater groups: This may indicate that you behave differently depending on your 
organizational relationship with people. Reflect on why this might be and if it is a beneficial approach 
or not.

Importance ratings: Competencies that your manager judges as important to your success in the 
job may merit more time and effort in your action plan.

Practise introducing yourself to potential customers or new business contacts. Consider your body

like “what is stopping you from saying yes?” Get confirmation of the deal, for example, “so will we begin the 
work next week.” Link your offering to their stated needs, for example, “this proposal will save you 5%, 
which is your key objective.” Don’t wait for the other person to close.

Development tip

When a report is particularly important, think of it as an oral presentation. Read your first draft aloud, and 
record yourself. When listening to the recording pay attention to the logical structure and clarity. Rewrite if 
necessary. Check the accuracy of critical facts and details and examine any assumptions underpinning 
your arguments.

silly or radical ones, as often they lead to creative but sensible conclusions. Try to avoid becoming habit-
bound and destroying creativity by an excessively critical response to ideas.

add feedback that might not be reflected in the ratings.

Building your action plan

While this report may offer valuable insight into your current strengths and development needs, the real 
benefit comes in reflecting on it and using it to develop an action plan to leverage your strengths and develop 
the areas where you want to be more effective, both in your current and future roles.

Ongoing communication with your manager will help ensure you have a shared understanding of where you’re 
focusing your efforts and what resources you’ll need.

limited information or analysis. Assess the steps you took to come to a final decision. Try to tackle 
future problems enthusiastically and constructively to give others confidence. Ask yourself what 
information is crucial and what information is “nice to have”. Set a clear timeframe for making decisions.

Reflection

As you reflect on what you have learned and on what action you can take, here are a few questions 
to help guide you.

What do you see as your two most important strengths , in relation to your role? Do others see these 
as a strength for you? How can you structure your approach to work to take advantage of your 
strengths?

What do you see as the two most important development areas for your role? How would enhancing 
your skills in these areas improve your performance on the job? What are some activities you could 
engage in to develop these? Are there people in your organization who could mentor you in these 
areas?

Notes

I am reviewing my 360-degree feedback report and identifying areas for improvement as well as opportunities 
for leveraging my strengths. I will focus on developing the necessary skills for personal growth in these areas.
