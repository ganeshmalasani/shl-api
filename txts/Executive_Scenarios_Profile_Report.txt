Introduction 

Mr. Sample Candidate completed Executive Scenarios. The test presented him with a number of different 
senior managerial scenarios followed by a number of possible responses and asked him to rate each of the 
responses for its effectiveness in dealing with that scenario. His responses have been compared with those 
of a large and appropriate comparison group. Mr. Sample Candidate’s performance on Executive 
Scenarios is presented as a profile. 

This information should be treated confidentially. The shelf life of the information contained in this report is 
considered to be 12 – 18 months, depending upon Mr. Sample Candidate’s work role and personal 
circumstances. 

Feeding Back Results 

Start by explaining the rationale for the test – it aims to assess senior-level managerial judgement, rather 
than test more general reasoning or personality. Ask about the person’s managerial background and 
experience of working at a senior role within large organisations. Briefly explain the main scale and each of 
the three sub-scales using the descriptions provided on the profile. Begin by feeding back on the 
Managerial Judgement scale, as this gives the individual an overall impression of how they have done. 
Next give feedback on each sub-scale in turn, using the following guideline: 

  90 percentile and above shows that their level of ability is substantially higher than that of most 

people with a similar background. 

  70 percentile to 89 percentile shows that their level of ability is somewhat higher than most 

people with a similar background. 

  31 percentile to 69 percentile shows that their level of ability is neither higher nor lower than 

that of other people with a similar background. 

  11 percentile to 30 percentile shows that their level of ability is somewhat lower than that of 

most people with a similar background. 

  10 percentile and below shows that their ability is substantially lower than that of most people 

with a similar background.

Executive Scenarios Profile 

The overall Managerial Judgement scale provides an assessment of your current level of 
judgement. Individuals who score strongly on the scale are demonstrating practical managerial 
judgement, and are therefore more likely to cope well with the demands of a real life executive or 
senior manager role. 

This scale is broken down into three areas or sub-scales, Managing Objectives, People 
Management and Corporate Management. Each of these sub-scales examines Managerial 
Judgement in a more specific area than the overall scale. 

These three sub-scales and the overall scale are scored against a set of correct answers. 
Research shows that the nearer an individual's responses are to these correct answers, the 
higher their level of managerial effectiveness.
