Introduction

This report provides a summary of the overall results for the group specified.

In each section, the collective results are shown for the entire group.  Results for particular individuals cannot be inferred from 
these overall results.

The information contained in this report can be useful in several ways.  Among these are the following:
• As benchmark data useful in interpreting individual results . Are an individual’s results higher or lower then, or similar to, the 
average for the group?
• As useful information in understanding the distribution of competencies across the group . What are the group’s relative strengths 
and weaknesses with respect to the assessed competencies?
• As documentation illustrating change in competency results over time , where the same (or similar) group is being re-assessed. 
Has an intervention within the organization had the desired impact on competency behavior?

In all cases, some care must be exercised in interpreting the results.   Small differences may be the result of random variation , and 
have not been subject to tests of statistical significance.

Competency Summary

This section summarises the ratings various rater groups gave to participants. The ratings shown here are the average of the ratings 
on the individual questions which make up a given competency.

Participant Self ratings are represented by the first bar from the top, followed by Manager ratings in the second bar.  If other groups of 
raters have participated, the next bars indicate the ratings of Colleagues, Direct Reports and Others.  The values summarise the 
average of the ratings on the questions forming a competency. The ratings of each rater group have been averaged across the group.

Please note:  Where “No Evidence” has been indicated by a rater, the average rating for any question is based on the responses from 
other raters, and that average is used in the calculation of the over-all competency rating for that rater group.

Frequency ratings per competency

This section describes how each item was rated by each category of raters. A table summarizes all ratings given by all participants for 
one competency. Additionally, the bottom line of the table indicates the average rating per category. 

In the example below, “Self” has rated all the items forming the competency “Judgement” with “3” except the last item which was rated 
with “5”. These ratings have an average value of “3,5”. 

For the category “colleagues”, item 1 has been rated with “4” and “5” by the two assessors. Item 2 has been rated with “2” and “3”, 
item 3 has been rated with “3” twice and item 4 has been rated with “3” and with “4”. The average value for the evaluation done by 
“colleagues” is “3,4”.

Please note: ‘No Evidence’  does not appear in the overview .
