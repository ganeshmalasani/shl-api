Description:
This report is more or less identical to the standard MFS report but with an additional section that looks at the performance versus the potential and plots the competencies on a four field grid to identify developed strengths, natural strengths, development need, or untapped potential.  The report text has been updated to reflect the inclusion of the OPQ, and the potential is also shown in the competency summary part of the report. The OPQ scores that feed into this report will need to be uploaded into MFS using an upload sheet based on a score extract from SODA or TC. This particular example report also includes development tips which are an optional extra.

OPQ AND 360° Review

Introduction

This report compares perceptions of your current performance, provided via 360 degree feedback, against an assessment 
of your likely potential.

This report is based on your responses to two forms of assessment:    

The Universal Competency Framework (UCF) 360-degree instrument    

The 360-degree feedback process provides an accurate snapshot of perceived performance in your current role. It is 
important to remember that whilst perceptions are not the whole truth they are the means by which we all form opinions of 
others. Please remember that it is quite normal for there to be differences in the ratings from various sources . This is 
because we all fulfil multiple roles at work, and are therefore seen to behave differently by different stakeholder groups . 
Exploring and seeking to understand the reasons behind these differing perceptions is all part of the development process . 
The performance profile contained within this report identifies both areas of strength and potential areas for development. 
Whilst building on strengths is central for career success, adapting established patterns of behaviour to suit new situations 
and challenges and tackling development needs all help to remove stumbling blocks and reduce the risk of career 
‘derailment’.

The Occupational Personality Questionnaire (OPQ)    

The Occupational Personality Questionnaire (OPQ) provides information on how your preffered style or typical way of 
behaving at work is likely to influence your potential on the selected competencies. The responses you gave to the OPQ 
are linked to competencies through research derived predictions of potential. This provides insights into your unique style 
of operating at work. This report can help you benchmark your potential against other managers and professionals.

Comparison of your Performance and your Potential    

Discrepancies between current performance and your potential performance can reveal areas of performance below or 
beyond expectations. Your feedback provider will work with you to explore how , in your career to date, you may have 
utilised strengths or overcome personal limitations and contextual challenges in the pursuit of success.

It is recommended that you read through your report with a trained facilitator.

Comparison of your Performance and Potential

This section provides a high level summary of the results of your assessments by contrasting your performance (the 
average of all non-self raters) and your potential for each of the competencies.

This information is displayed in the form of a 2x2 graphic and is also repeated within the table on the next page.

If available the importance of each competency as rated by your manager and yourself is included.

Competency Summary

This section summarizes how you have been rated by your various (groups of) raters on each of the competencies. These 
are the average of the ratings on the individual questions which make up a given competency. This section will enable you 
to see at a glance how your self perception compares with how others see you. It can be used as a basis for identifying the 
competencies in need for further exploration.

Your own ratings are represented by the first bar from the top , followed by your manager’s ratings in the second bar . If 
other groups of raters have participated, the next bars indicate the ratings of your colleagues, your direct reports and 
others respectively. The values summarize the average of the ratings on the questions forming a competency. The ratings 
of a group of raters have been averaged across the group.    

Please note: Where ‘No Evidence’ has been indicated by a rater, the average rating for any question is based on the 
ratings given by the remaining assessors in that group.  A superscript number alongside the rating indicates how many 
assessors this rating is based on. N/E indicates that all raters in that group rated ‘No Evidence’ for that item .

The measure of competency potential is shown on the bottom bar of the graph. This is based on your responses to the 
OPQ and has a different key (OPQ review).

When trying to close a deal, get confirmation that you have the other person’s commitment : ask questions like “if it was within 
your budget would you buy?” Openly identify objections they may have, with questions like “what is stopping you from saying 
yes?” Get confirmation of the deal, for example, “so will we begin the work next week. ” Link your offering to their stated needs, 
for example, “this proposal will save you 5%, which is your key objective.” Don’t wait for the other person to close.
