About this report

This report is based on a decade of research into high-potential programs and the qualities that distinguish those 
individuals with the strongest likelihood of rising to and being effective in more senior and challenging roles. The 
report draws on the SHL Model of High-Potential1 and uses a number of assessments to identify strengths 
against key elements of that model.

The SHL Model of High-Potential1

A high-potential individual is a proven high performer with the aspiration, ability and engagement to rise to and 
succeed in more senior, critical positions:

● Aspiration – to rise to senior roles

● Ability – to be effective in more responsible and senior roles

● Engagement – to commit to the organisation and remain in 

challenging roles

What the Report Covers

This report focuses on two of the elements in the SHL model to address critical questions that determine 
individual and high-potential program success:

Aspiration to rise to a senior managerial or executive position. This is reported through six 
motivational factors and two critical behaviours that SHL and Gartner research shows significantly 
improve the odds of achieving a senior position in organisations. This part of the report addresses the 
question, "Who is most likely to successfully rise to a more senior position?"

Ability to be effective in more senior managerial and leadership positions. This is reported using the 
SHL Corporate Leadership Model, used by organisations globally, to show future potential against 
four critical managerial (transactional) competencies and four critical leadership (transformational) 
competencies. This part of the report addresses the question who is most likely to be a top performer 
in a more senior managerial and leadership role?

Those with high aspiration and high ability are more likely to be true high-potential individuals. For these 
individuals, the key question is: who is most likely to stay with the organisation? Guidance is provided at the end 
of this report on how to assess for Engagement using observational evidence of the individual’s current 
commitment to their role and their longer-term attachment to the organisation.

The Assessments Used

The report is based on scores from a suite of assessments mapped to the SHL Model of High-Potential1:

Assessment Summary

The scores shown below summarise the individual’s likelihood of both rising to and being effective in a more 
senior and challenging managerial and leadership role. The sections that follow in this report provide more detail 
on how these two scores were obtained from the assessments administered.

Notes
The information provided above relates to the individual’s future potential and not their current performance. It is 
based on research across organisations globally that shows how critical aspects of motivation and behaviour 
predict later career outcomes. The Aspiration score predicts the likelihood of achieving a senior position such 
as an executive level, and the Ability score predicts the likelihood of being a top performer once a senior 
position has been achieved.

How the Aspiration Score Was Calculated

SHL and Gartner research shows that the likelihood of achieving a more senior role is substantially increased 
when individuals are higher on six critical motivational factors and two behaviours that enable people to translate 
those motivations into tangible career success. Details of how the individual compares on the critical motivational 
factors and behaviours are shown below.

Scores on these eight areas have been combined to create an overall Aspiration score. This overall score 
compares the motivational factors and behaviours to a relevant norm group using a scale from very low to very 
high. Details of the population the individual has been compared to are given at the end of this report.

How the Ability Score Was Calculated

SHL and Gartner research shows that the likelihood of performing effectively and being effective in a future 
senior managerial and leadership role is dependent on how strong an individual’s talents are across Managerial 
(transactional) and Leadership (transformational) competencies. Details of how the individual scores on the 
Managerial and Leadership competencies compared to a relevant norm group are shown below. 

The overall Ability score shown at the top of this page is not an average. To provide clearer discrimination 
between candidates, the overall Ability score shows where the individual's combined Managerial score and 
Leadership score compares to a relevant norm group using a scale from very low to very high. Details of the

Engagement

Why Assess Engagement?

In addition to Aspiration and Ability, it is also critical for organisations to evaluate an individual’s level of 
Engagement for two key reasons:

Return on Investment: organisations need to be assured that their investment in high-potential individuals will 
provide a return over time. They need to make sure these high-value investments do not leave to join 
competitors. At their core, high-potential programs are an investment in the organisation’s most promising and 
valuable talent. With resources scarce, these programs need to direct investment to individuals who are engaged 
in their work, committed to the organisation and likely to remain with their organisation.

Managing high-potential engagement risks: SHL and Gartner research shows that effective high-potential 
programs use practical and straightforward steps to manage engagement levels. They equip managers to 
identify engagement risks and evaluate individuals' emotional and rational commitment to the organisation. 
Moreover, progressive organisations protect their investment in high-potentials by formally asking individuals 
entering their programs to recognise the company’s investment in them and commit to the organisation.

Engaged high-potentials are twice as likely to stay with the organisation as 
those who display low engagement.

High-potential individuals must have strong commitment to the organisation and to building a career with their 
employer to increase their likelihood of staying and being engaged in future, more senior roles. 

When measuring an individual’s level of Engagement, managers should consider the items below (these are not 
exhaustive and should be complemented with your own). 

Current Engagement – An individual's emotional and rational commitment based on their perceptions of past 
and present experiences. Managers should consider behaviours such as whether an individual:

● Displays a high level of interest in their work

● Invests time and energy to do things really well

● Volunteers to do extra work to help others when needed

Future Engagement – An individual's emotional and rational commitment based on their expectations of their 
future employment experience. Examples of behaviours that managers should consider are whether an 
individual:

● Prioritises the company and team ahead of personal needs or interests

● Makes plans for personal career growth with the company

● Asks questions that demonstrate interest in the organisation and its success

Assessment Details

The accuracy of this report will depend on the range of assessments used. Clients may choose to use some 
elements of the suite described. A more accurate diagnosis will be obtained where the full suite of assessments 
has been used.

Motivation Questionnaire
The Motivation Questionnaire (MQ) assesses the energy with which a person approaches tasks and what 
situations are likely to increase or reduce an individual’s motivation. Information from this assessment is used in 
assessing an individual's Aspiration as defined by the SHL Model of High-Potential1.

Occupational Personality Questionnaire (OPQ32r)TM
The OPQ provides detailed information on 32 specific personality characteristics which underpin an individual’s 
behaviour at work and their performance against key competencies. Unlike other personality questionnaires, the 
OPQ is an occupational model of personality designed solely for use in a business environment. Information from 
this assessment is used in assessing an individual’s Aspiration and Ability as defined by the SHL Model of 
High-Potential1.
