Introduction 

Executive Scenarios assesses Managerial Judgement at executive and senior management level. It 
assesses an individual’s ability to evaluate ‘real’ high-level challenging managerial situations and decide 
on appropriate and effective ways of handling them. It assesses an individual’s ability to weigh up new 
challenging situations and to identify or make sound judgements in dealing with these situations. Each 
situation is presented as a realistic executive-level scenario and the individual then rates a set of possible 
responses in dealing with the scenario. The individual’s rating is compared against the optimal rating 
(correct answer) for each of the responses, and this enables this report to provide specific and detailed 
feedback. 

This report is in two sections. The first section presents an overview of your performance, as a profile. The 
second section presents feedback of the main scale and three subscales from the profile, together with 
narrative interpretations and analysis of your performance on each of the three subscales including 
detailed feedback based on your particular responses to the test. 

This report should be treated confidentially. The shelf life of the information contained in this report is 
considered to be 12 months, depending upon your work role and personal circumstances.

Executive Scenarios Profile 

The overall Managerial Judgement scale provides an assessment of your current level of judgement. 
Individuals who score strongly on the scale are demonstrating practical managerial judgement, and are 
therefore more likely to cope well with the demands of a real life executive or senior manager role. 

This scale is broken down into three areas or sub-scales, Managing Objectives, People Management and 
Corporate Management. Each of these sub-scales examines Managerial Judgement in a more specific 
area than the overall scale. 

These three sub-scales and the overall scale are scored against a set of correct answers. Research 
shows that the nearer an individual's responses are to these correct answers, the higher their level of 
managerial effectiveness.

Feedback Report 

Managerial Judgement 

Executive Scenarios measures Managerial Judgement at senior level – an individual’s ability to weigh up 
“real life” senior management situations and decide on appropriate and effective ways of handling them. 
Performance on all the questions in Executive Scenarios is used to provide a broad, general assessment 
of this skill. The scale gives an assessment of your ability to cope with a range of senior manager 
situations typically found in medium-sized or large organisations. 

Taking into account your responses to all the questions in the test, and comparing you with the group, the 
indication is that there is considerable scope for you to develop your managerial judgement. This may be 
because you have had little experience of dealing with real-life senior management situations, or perhaps 
because you tend not to reflect greatly on the longer term impact of your actions as a manager. You might 
benefit from considering the consequences of your actions on the systems and people around you. You 
might also benefit from taking time to consider what you have learnt from your past managerial 
experience.

Managing Objectives 

The Managing Objectives subscale measures an individual’s ability to take practical and pragmatic action 
to deal with current objectives-based issues, challenges or crises, so that operations and key company 
activities/initiatives remain on track. This often involves building relationships, resolving issues and 
addressing others’ concerns. The subscale also measures an individual’s ability to reach out for and use 
appropriate external expertise when tackling these challenges. 

It includes: 

● 

● 

● 

● 

the ability to make timely decisions to direct operations, progress business plans, manage priorities, 
ensuring wider strategic objectives are met 

the ability to address emerging issues, either within the business or within business collaborations, by 
building relationships, resolving issues and addressing others’ concerns 

the ability to look beyond the organisation to outside expertise when tackling issues 

the ability to understand how dealing with current issues impacts on the organisation’s performance and 
wider strategy 

Compared to the group, it appears that your ability to both provide leadership and to engage external 
expertise when meeting current business and operational challenges is less effective than your peers. 
There is scope to develop your judgement in this area. 

As a leader you can become better at identifying the positive action required to deal with emerging 
problems and issues, including issues that lie beyond the organisation with partners or stakeholders. 
There may well be times when your judgement causes the organisation to under-commit effort and 
resources. 

You can improve your ability to be an active, practical and realistic planner, to progress business initiatives 
and to prioritise for others. In doing so try to be more positive about building relationships, resolving issues 
and addressing others’ concerns. 

When deciding on or judging what action should be taken on current business challenges, you are 
sometimes unsure about how best to utilise outside expertise. You can become a better judge of when to 
enlist outside help and thinking. Try looking beyond the organisation to outside expertise and support 
when tackling issues.

Feedback on Managing Objectives 

Managing Objectives comprises two key themes:- 

Leading and Managing the Work, which is about providing leadership and support to others in dealing 
with the current business issues. It is also having the skills to effectively plan and deal with operational 
challenges and wider partnership or business activities. 

Using External Help, which is about seeing the need to and being highly proactive in seeking appropriate 
support or advice. Hence, understanding one’s strengths and limitations and seeking external support, 
gaining professional or expert advice, and buying in specialist resources to gain a competitive advantage. 

Leading And Managing The Work 
(Providing leadership on current business and operational challenges) 

Development Tips 

Consider ways of supporting staff re-deployment. 

See if you can help resolve disputes or act as the mediator to seek senior level agreement on the way forward. 

Seek to use surveys and other business information more effectively to support your case when dealing with 
internal resistance to proposals. 

Consider continuing to progress the detail of a new proposal facing opposition – it may help to unblock 
resistance. 

Ensure that you provide sufficient focus on partnership activities, and that such activities are kept firmly on track.

Using External Help 
(Engaging appropriate external expertise) 

Development Tips 

There are no specific development tips for you in this area, but some general advice is provided in the section 
below. 

General development advice for individuals wanting to develop their judgement in the area of 
Managing Objectives 

●  As a manager, ensure you are able to set clear expectations to all. Are your staff clear about what they 

are doing and why? Do your customers have clear service expectations? 

●  As a manager, consider the challenges your staff face in managing their time effectively and dealing with 
pressures of workload and what the likely options are. Discuss and coach them on such issues so that 
they are equipped to solve these problems more independently. 

●  When deciding how best to tackle business issues, challenges and crises, remember the option of 

engaging external help, advice or expertise. You don’t need to do everything on your own. 

●  Observe other leaders’ business situations and challenges, and practise making the tough calls and 

courageous decisions as if for real. Did you get the decision right? Did you spot the most effective 
solution? Did you get to the core of the problem?

●  Use business information to your advantage. Consider how best to collect such data, how best to use it to 

make informed business decisions and how best to communicate it. Understand its potential power and 
limitations in influencing others. 

●  Consider how you can act as a mediator and help resolve difficult situations between stakeholders 

through active listening and diffusing the situation; then helping to identify a way forward.

People Management 

The People Management sub-scale measures an individual’s ability to manage the organisation’s people 
issues so that it can better meet business objectives. It measures the ability to resolve disputes and tackle 
motivation, morale, communication and performance issues affecting individuals or the workforce as a 
whole. 

It includes: 

● 

● 

the willingness and ability to openly resolve disputes between key individuals and parties, by 
understanding their different perspectives 

the ability to work with individuals, for example effectively dealing with performance and communication 
issues, or judging when colleagues can and cannot progress issues for you 

● 

the ability to tackle motivation, morale and performance issues affecting the workforce 

●  dealing effectively with people issues at a strategic and senior level 

Compared to the group, it appears that your ability to manage the organisation’s people issues is slightly 
less effective than that of your peers. Although your judgement on some aspects of people management is 
sound, there is probably scope to develop your judgement in this area. 

Occasionally you may favour quick action to force an end to disputes between parties or individuals, 
leaving underlying tensions unresolved. Try being more willing to take action to openly resolve disputes 
between key individuals and parties, to the benefit of all over the longer term. 

You might benefit from sharpening your judgement when dealing with individuals, being more objective 
and perhaps being more determined to work through issues. Occasionally you avoid directly addressing 
difficult performance and communication issues or don’t take them seriously enough. For example at times 
you might place colleagues in a difficult position by requesting they progress issues for you. At other times 
you may miss the opportunity to more fully communicate with colleagues or to help them improve their 
performance. 

There may be scope for you to address motivation, morale and performance issues within the workforce 
more effectively. Occasionally you either under-react to staff concerns, or over-react by escalating a 
situation or dismissing it as irretrievable. Try developing a more balanced approach, working through a 
people situation as it is to resolve it rather than down-playing its significance or quickly dismissing it as 
beyond retrieval. 

You can also fine tune your judgment on when action is required on people issues, and can become better 
at distinguishing between good and bad interventions.

Feedback on People Management 

People Management comprises two key themes:- 

One-To-One, is about the skills to communicate effectively and address issues with individuals. This will 
include dealing with performance and motivational issues, dealing with conflict situations and the ability to 
build sustainable relationships with others by operating professionally and respectfully. 

Workforce, is about the skills to communicate effectively and address issues with the wider workforce. 
This will include dealing with communications relating to changes, performance expectations, targets, or 
tackling grievances or conflicts. It is about demonstrating the appropriate support to the workforce that 
ultimately benefits the business. 

One-To-One 
(Addressing motivation, morale, conflict and performance issues involving individuals) 

Development Tips 

Appreciate the limitations of simply telling people that they should be more tolerant of tensions and different 
organisational cultures – more direct action may be required. 

- 

- 

Workforce 
(Addressing motivation, morale, conflict and performance issues affecting part or all of the workforce) 

Development Tips 

Ensure that you are not too protective in defending your team, despite the actions of some other 
managers.  You may increase the risk of a drop in team working across the whole organisation. 

Consider carefully the consequences of addressing team working problems at senior level caused 
by seeking to remove the apparently guilty parties. 

When reviewing a challenging business activity such as a joint venture that is going through a 
difficult period, support the managers of the joint venture as best as you can with ideas for 
possible turnaround, rather than just recommending ceasing the business arrangement too early.

General development advice for individuals wanting to develop their judgement in the area of 
People Management 

●  Try fine-tuning your ability to read people situations at work. Think through how effective 

your potential decisions might be. Put yourself in the other person’s perspective. Ask others 
what they think. 

●  Take the lead in resolving motivation, morale and conflict issues. People look to senior 

leaders for signs that things can improve and can be tackled. 

●  Treat staff decently and respectfully. Although at times you may think they deserve to be 
treated poorly in order to teach them a lesson, it will affect their morale and they will lose 
respect for you. Often the most sustainable way to improve others’ behaviours is by 
improving your own behaviours towards others rather than directly attempting to change 
others. 

●  Try to understand performance issues from the individual’s perspective. This might guide 

you to appropriate interventions e.g. appropriate training or coaching, confidence building, 
working on attitude, better communications on clarifying expectations. 

●  Focus more on understanding individuals, their preferences and their needs. Also, the same 
applies for different groups of people who might have different cultures and backgrounds. 
Link this to appreciating what their needs and motivations might be. 

●  Understand the demands that the organisation places on people and what aspects might 

create frustration, concern, or worry for them e.g. workload issues, rumours of 
organisational change. 

●  Ensure you are open and communicative with all staff especially in times when staff feel 

there is a lot of uncertainty within the business. 

●  Be adaptable with people – as they are all different, so adapt to them to build a good 

rapport and provide the support that works best for them e.g. some might respond well to a 
coaching style, others might prefer clear, direct instructions to follow.

Corporate Management 

The Corporate Management sub-scale measures an individual’s ability to take a corporate approach when 
tackling issues: one that benefits the whole organisation, and supports and sustains it both internally and 
commercially. This involves putting oneself out and making the effort to personally address tough 
challenges facing the organisation. 

It includes: 

●  persistently tackling tough corporate issues and challenges not necessarily of your own making, rather 

than avoiding them or giving up early 

● 

taking action that ultimately benefits the whole organisation 

● 

seizing opportunities and tackling commercial issues so that the business is supported and sustained 

●  building corporate strategy that is sustainable 

Compared to the group, it appears that your ability to take a corporate approach that supports and 
sustains the organisation is less effective than that of your peers. There is scope to develop your 
judgement in this area. 

When faced with tough issues, you tend to underestimate your chances of success if you take action. High 
scorers on the corporate management subscale tend to be optimistic, relaxed, adaptable and social 
confident individuals – are you being too pessimistic in your judgements and giving up or giving in too 
early in the face of obstacles or difficulties? Are you inclined to avoid tough issues? 

You are more inclined than your peers to place the internal cohesion and commercial success of the 
organisation at risk by avoiding issues. Try seeking solutions that ultimately benefit the whole organisation. 

You may sometimes fail to fully tackle commercial issues, risking the commercial progress needed to 
support and sustain the business. Try to tackle rather than accept obstacles to progress more often.

Feedback on Corporate Management 

Corporate Management comprises two key themes:- 

Organisational Support, is about having the underlying values, loyalty and skills to fully support the 
organisation. One will proactively address corporate issues and improve organisational processes to 
achieve improvements and sustained benefits for the company. 

Commercial Support, is about having the skills and the persistence to drive through new business 
ventures and opportunities. One will help develop and see the potential of such commercial undertakings 
and will address any resistance and avoid compromises that might dilute the commercial advantage. 

Organisational Support 
(Taking a corporate approach that supports and sustains the organisation) 

Development Tips 

Ensure that you do not give up on  people from certain parts of the business e.g. from a part that is about to 
close. 

Address strained relationships between different parts of the business or between business partners. 

- 

- 

Commercial Support 
(Taking a corporate approach that supports and sustains the business commercially) 

Development Tips 

Address senior-level resistance to new business opportunities; get to the bottom of the concerns and do this 
quickly to ensure that things are not delayed. 

Do not give up too easily to competitors and allow them to enter the market first, thinking you can enter later and 
learn from their mistakes. 

General development advice for individuals wanting to develop their judgement in the area of 
Corporate Management 

●  Corporate decision making involves making decisions that benefit the organisation, and 
supporting the majority or the wider team – even if it means it might be at your own or 
immediate team’s expense.  Be sure that your decisions support the organisation, rather 
than avoiding difficult situations or giving up. 

●  Ensure you prioritise actions that support the organisation’s commercial future, even where 

this means tackling difficult issues. 

●  Have the conviction to deal with tough decisions that will benefit the wider business by 

properly addressing issues rather than to take the easy decisions that are short-term fixes, 
or that just shifts the problems elsewhere. 

●  Think carefully through commercial tactics.  However, progressing business is very much 
about exploring new approaches, and taking calculated risks.  So be proactive, seize 
opportunities and don’t give up too easily with business ideas.

●  Work closely with stakeholders and partners and explore options together to resolve issues 

and find new opportunities. 

●  Focus on the wider corporate good rather than on defending or protecting your own area, or 

getting side-tracked into internal disputes and office politics which detract from supporting 
the organisation’s objectives. 

●  Consider and use the appropriate channels in tackling issues and disputes, so that the 

integrity and reputation of the business is preserved.
